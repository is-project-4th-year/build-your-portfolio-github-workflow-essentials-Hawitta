## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like **(Expectation ðŸ‘€)**

I came in thinking expecting to learn basics on Github (things I already knew), like commiting and merging conflicts. I thought I would just relearn what I do with all my other repositories

What I actually learned **(Reality ðŸ˜…)**

I learned much more than I expected. I understood how to properly add commit messages, how to use milestones and labels to categorize tasks that needed to be done. I am geniunely more confident now in using Github without the fear of merge conflicts or overwriting a collegue's work. 

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project ðŸ’»

I have gone from following the steps on a paper, to actually performing the tasks smoothly without causing conflict or confusion on my commits. I have been able to make branches for separate tasks and attach them to issues and milestones quite easily now.
